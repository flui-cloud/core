/**
 * Storage conventions for Flui workload clusters.
 *
 * Architecture (decided 2026-05-10, see APPLICATION_SCALING_AND_RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT.md §14):
 *
 *   Master VM
 *   ├── nfs-kernel-server (NFSv4 export)
 *   └── Volume Flui-managed (provider block storage, attached, ext4)
 *       └── Mounted at FLUI_SHARED_STORAGE_PATH
 *
 *   Worker VM
 *   ├── cachefilesd (read-cache to local NVMe)
 *   └── NFS mount of master:FLUI_SHARED_STORAGE_PATH at the same path
 *
 *   local-path-provisioner is reconfigured to write to FLUI_SHARED_STORAGE_PATH
 *   on every node, so PVCs of catalog apps with `storageClassName=flui-shared`
 *   become subdirectories on the master's Volume — visible from any worker.

 *   use `flui-dedicated` instead).
